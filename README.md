# Day 1 : Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK 

### IC Design Terminology

#### Key Components:
- **Package**: A case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from damage and allows for mounting electrical contacts connecting it to the PCB.
- **Die**: A small block of semiconductor material where the circuit is fabricated.
- **Core**: The actual area of the IC where logic resides.
- **Pads**: Interfaces between the internal signals of a chip and external pins, connected via wire bonds.

 ![F1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de1f657a-1cda-46fd-b2a5-57428b741a65)

#### Simple Definitions:
- **Package** = Protective case with pins
- **Die** = Tiny brain of the chip
- **Core** = The part where the processing happens
- **Pads** = Connection points between the chip and the outside world

![F1_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/087ef17a-c801-46d4-9642-620468c1fcdf)


### Application to Hardware Flow
1. **Operating System (OS)**
   - Manages hardware
   - Provides functions in C, C++, Java, etc.
2. **Compiler**

### Introduction to Floorplanning


![F2_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae3123b-e4c0-4599-b795-2b5dae1d053e)

![F2_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278f10d5-06f7-441f-b463-7437282c249c)
### Key Concepts:

#### Aspect Ratio
- Ratio of height to width of core area
- Aspect ratio of 1 indicates square shape

#### Utilization Factor
- Ratio of netlist area to core area
- Recommended range: 0.5 to 0.7

#### Preplaced Cells
- Fixed location cells
- Examples: memory blocks, clock gating cells, comparators

#### Decoupling Capacitors
- Used with preplaced cells
- Compensates voltage drop
- Charges to supply voltage

#### Power Planning
- Provides power to all components
- Creates power grid network
- Mitigates voltage droop

### Implementation Steps

1. **Run Floorplan**
```bash
run_floorplan
```
**Load Floorplan in Magic**
```bash
magic -T $PDK/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

```

![F2_6_b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df177928-4c15-4926-aa3e-635345d443de)

# Post-Route parasitic extraction

Parasitics command is already run and spef is extracted

In runs folder, where routing outputs are dumped and we'll find the SPEF there.
