### IC Design Terminology

#### Key Components:
- **Package**: A case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from damage and allows for mounting electrical contacts connecting it to the PCB.
- **Die**: A small block of semiconductor material where the circuit is fabricated.
- **Core**: The actual area of the IC where logic resides.
- **Pads**: Interfaces between the internal signals of a chip and external pins, connected via wire bonds.

 ![F1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de1f657a-1cda-46fd-b2a5-57428b741a65)

#### Simple Definitions:
- **Package** = Protective case with pins
- **Die** = Tiny brain of the chip
- **Core** = The part where the processing happens
- **Pads** = Connection points between the chip and the outside world

# THEORY :


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f516492f-125d-4c06-95ae-ae56ad23bb74)

here H= height , w = width


# Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio

Utilization Factor : It is the area occupied by the netlsit to the total area of the core.

* when the utilization factor is 1 that is 100% ,which means the core is completely occupied by the logic.

  #  Utilization Factor = Area Occupied by the netlsit / Total area of the core.

Aspect Ratio : height of core diveded by width of core

* When aspect Ratio is 1 it indicates that the chip is square shape. when aspect ratio is other than 1,indicates that the chip is rectangular shape.
  
# Aspect Ratio = height / width


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/404a3d9f-1b33-49a0-a03f-961ded64627b)



Let's put the dimensions we have, we get

Utilization factor = 4*1sq.unit / 4unit *2unit = 0.5

So, utilization factor = 0.5 (It signifies Rectangle shape)

Aspect Ratio = Height / width = 2 unit / 2unit = 1

Whenever Aspect Ratio is 1 it signifies that chip is square shaped. When it is not 1 it means the chip is in rectangular shape.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd143dd9-0077-4ac2-b656-0b5f7c2774e0)


so the design will look like above image


# Pre-palced cells : 
Blocks have user-defined locations,and hence are placed in chip before automated placememt-and-routing and are called as pre-placed cells.


# De-coupling Capacitors

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56fc86f1-dd29-4336-918e-8b7886c94039)

Consider the amount of switching current required for a complex circuit something like above

1.consider capacitance to be zero for the discussiion. Rdd,Rss,Ldd and Lss are well defined values.

2.During switching operation ,the circuit demands switching current i.e peak current (I peak)

3.Now,due to the presence od Rddand Ldd,there will be a voltage drop access them and the voltage at Node 'A would be Vdd' instead of Vdd. 

# Noise Margin :

** If Vdd goes below the noise margin ,due to Rdd and Ldd ,the logic '1' at the output of circuit wont be detected as logic '1' at the input of the circuit following this circuit  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdc9474d-0edc-4da6-b9f6-3d4f6fb5c90f)

We soleve this problem using by adding De-coupling Capcacitors 

sol: 1. Addition of Decoupling Capacitor in parallel with the circuit .

2.Every time the circuit switches,it draws current from Cd, whereas ,the RL network is used to replenish the charge into Cd.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9924785a-396d-4d0d-84bb-0147c6fd7cea)

* The above image is the adding de-coupling capacitor to the design.

# Optimized Placement 

** Optimized placement is the stage  where we estimate wire length and capacitance and,based on that ,insert repeators.

# Day 2 LAb REPORTS

The Next step after synthesis is floorplan

Run the floorplan using the command run_floorplan

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f407ae6-3912-42da-b72b-a881414e3499)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f18339d-40eb-4131-9905-bd7ba9317a94)

After run the floorplan we have one def file i.e picorv32a.floorplan.def

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d23bfa-e41a-4cc7-afd6-775addc89728)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c56fe23-8295-4bef-ba2b-19faac8c12b5)

In above the die area = (0 0)  (660685  671405)

1 micron=1000 database units

width=660685/1000 = 660.685

height = 671405/1000 = 671.405

# Palcement 
 
after floorplan next step is placemnet 

run the placement by using the command 'run_placement' 

Placement : Placement is the stage where the standard cell placement can be fixed.

In placement there are two steps 

1)Global Placemet: It is nothing but coars placement

2)Detailed placement : It is nothing but legalized placement
